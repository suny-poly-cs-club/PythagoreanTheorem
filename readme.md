Pythagorean Theorem
===================

The Pythagorean Theorem is an equation developed by Pythagoras to calculate the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.

The equation is
> a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>

where a and b are the lengths of the sides, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.

For this exercise, implement methods for finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle, given two sides, and a side of a
triangle, given the other side and the hypotenuse. In other words, find c given a and b, and find a, given b and c. 

Also, implement the verify method to check that the given a, b, and c are a solution to the equation.

Hint: Java has a Math class which includes sqrt() and pow() methods.
