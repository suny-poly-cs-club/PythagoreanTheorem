Pythagorean Theorem
===================

The Pythagorean Theorem is an equation developed by Pythagoras to calculate the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.

The equation is
> a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>

where a and b are the lengths of the sides, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.

For this exercise, implement the Pythagorean Theorem such that
>c = sqrt(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>)

Hint: Java has a Math class which includes sqrt() and pow() methods.
